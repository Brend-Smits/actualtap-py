# New Updates
- Added logging
- Secure all endpoints with API github-token
- Fixed formatting in logs

# What's Different between this and ActualTap?
- Written in Python
- Uses config.yml file over .env variables
- Saves the request into a wallet.json in your phone so you can re-submit it if you have no internet access
- Allows mapping of Tap to Pay accounts -> Actual account ID via config file
